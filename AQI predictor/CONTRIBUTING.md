## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting bugs

1. Before submitting a bug report, make sure to do a cursory search on [issues](https://github.com/Ozon3Org/Ozon3/issues) to see if it's already reported. If it's already reported, add a comment under the issue thread instead of opening a new one.

2. Use clear and descriptive title.

3. Include in the body of the issue:

   - **Expected behavior**: What do you expect should happen?
   - **Actual behavior**: What actually happened and why it's a problem?
   - **Steps to reproduce the problem**. Be very specific. Give example code block. Other contributors want to run it in their device to make sure they see what you saw. Having detailed steps and examples can make it easier to demonstrate and track down a problem.
   - **Version information**: What version of Python you're using? What version of Ozon3? Do you install through `pip` or by cloning the Github repository? What is your OS and what version?

   You can include screenshots/GIFs, if relevant.

Additionally, you can also confirm other people's bug report by running their provided code and steps in your local machine and see if the same problem shows up. Every test helps, especially if your device setup is different (i.e. has different OS or Python version) from the original bug report.

### Suggesting enhancements/features

1. Before submitting a feature suggestion,  make sure to do a cursory search in [issues](https://github.com/Ozon3Org/Ozon3/issues) to see if it's already suggested.

2. Use clear and descriptive title.

3. Lay out the details of your suggestion in the body issue. Make sure to also:

   - Describe the current behavior and explain what would you like to see instead.
   - Explain why your suggestion would be useful for Ozon3 users.

### Making a pull request

You can also make a pull request to fix an existing bug or add a feature.

Unsure where to begin contributing to Ozon3? You can start by looking through these  `first-contribution`, `beginner`, `help-wanted` issues:

* `first-contribution` issues should only require a few lines of code or are improvements on the documentation.
* `beginner` issues are a step up, and may involve a couple of methods/tests.
* `help-wanted` issues are slightly trickier.

One very important thing is to make sure you only make PR's to the `dev` branch and not the `main` branch. The main branch is stable, and `dev` branch changes will be merged into `main` periodically once it's confirmed that they don't have any breaking changes.

### Get an issue assigned to you

If you find an issue that you'd like to tackle - get it assigned to yourself by commenting on it with:

```
Hold my beer, I got this
```

## Setting Up Local Development Environment

### Getting a local copy

1. Fork this repository.

2. Clone your fork to your local device.

3. Set your fork as `origin` remote. This is usually done automatically if you're using `git clone` command. To do it manually:

   ```sh
   git remote add origin URL_OF_YOUR_FORK
   ```

4. Set original repository as `upstream` remote.

   ```sh
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/Ozon3Org/Ozon3.git
   ```

5. Pull from original repository to make sure you're synced up.

   ```sh
   git pull upstream dev:dev
   ```

   You may want to do it once in a long while to make sure your local dev branch is in sync with the `upstream` remote.

6. Checkout the `dev` branch, and make a new branch from there to make changes.

   ```sh
   git checkout dev
   git checkout -b my-feature-branch
   ```

### Setting up a development environment

1. Create and activate a virtual environment.

   e.g. using Python's built-in `venv` module:

   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   venv/scripts/activate
   ```

2. Within the virtual environment, install the requirements. Afterwards, install the package in editable mode.

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -e .
   ```

3. Activate pre-commit hooks.

   ```sh
   pre-commit install
   ```

   From this point on, pre-commit hooks will run linters and formatters automatically before every commit. If there's a problem, the commit will abort. You'll need to fix the problem before committing again.

   > It's normal for pre-commit to take some time.

   > When Black reformats a staged file, the pre-commit will fail. It is normal and expected. See [this discussion](https://github.com/Ozon3Org/Ozon3/discussions/85). Just stage the file and commit again, it should pass the second time.

4. Your local development environment is ready to use. Feel free to code away. Make sure to only commit logical changes that are already tested. Don't commit things you just try out and haven't tested.

5. When you're done coding, again, **test out the changes that you've made to the package.** Proceed if all is good.

   > See [next section](#test-suite) for instructions about Ozon3's test suite.

### Pushing changes and opening a pull request

1. Push the changes to your forked repository.

2. Return to your forked repository on Github and click on `compare and pull request` to begin the PR. **Make sure the base branch is `dev`, not `main`.**

3. Describe your PR, submit it and wait for it to be merged! You may be required to do additional work or changes before it is merged.

## Test Suite

Ozon3 has a test suite that lives in `tests/` directory, which has the following structure within:

Directories:

1. `cassettes/`: Location of vcrpy and pytest-recording cassettes.

Files:

1. `conftest.py`: Location of pytest global and configuration fixtures.
2. `utils.py`: Location of global Python helper objects (i.e. constants and `Ozon3` instance) to use in tests.
3. `test_*.py`: Test files, each file is testing one public method.

### Setting up and running tests

After setting development environment as pointed out above, you should already have all necessary testing packages installed. To run all tests, invoke this command from the root directory.

```sh
pytest
```

Some tests are slow and marked accordingly. To skip tests that are marked as "slow", you can use

```sh
pytest --skip-slow
```

If you want to run only specific tests, refer to (pytest documentation)[https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/how-to/usage.html] for a more complete information. The following is an example for how to run only the test functions starting with the pattern `output_data_format`

```sh
pytest -k "output_data_format"
```

If any of your tests fail because of a VCR error such as `vcr.errors.CannotOverWriteExistingCassetteException` while running the above commands, that could mean the cassette needs to be updated. See [below](#adding-or-updating-cassettes) for information.

### Updating tests

Generally, tests should correspond to the necessary specification/expectation of Ozon3 users. Tests will help us identify if our code is still in line with such expectations.

Tests should be updated when e.g.:
- There is new expectation on how should Ozon3 behave. In this case, the tests need to be updated accordingly.
- There is a new functionality. In this case, add necessary tests accordingly.
- There is a new bug or previously unencountered or undocumented behavior. Add them to the existing tests when fixing it, to make sure the same bug will never slip past again in the future.

### About the cassettes and pytest-recording

This test suite is testing Ozon3's functionality, therefore interaction with outside sources are mocked. Ozon3 uses pytest-recording plugin that uses vcrpy under the hood to record request-response pairs.

These request-response pairs are stored as `.yaml` files in `tests/cassettes` directory. When an outbound request is made, pytest-recording will look for that request's response in the tests' `.yaml` file instead of actually letting the request go through to WAQI.

The `tests/cassettes` directory is organized as follows:

- Each folder per one test file.
- Each `.yaml` file per one test function.

For the purposes of this test suite, these request-response pairs are all **assumed** to be complete and correct. In the unlikely event that WAQI API changes their specifications, these request-response pairs need to be re-recorded. See the [next section](#adding-or-updating-cassettes).

### Adding or updating cassettes

By default, pytest-recording will only use existing cassettes for testing, and will raise error if there's a new interaction that is not contained in existing cassettes. This prevents "accidentally" making a request that is not already been mocked.

Cassettes are generally assumed to be complete (covers all the request-response pairs ever needed by the test function) and correct (exactly similar to what WAQI API would send over the live wire). But sometimes, it might not always be the case.

Sometimes when fixing a failing test (or updating a previously passing test), the next runs fail because of a vcr exception `vcr.errors.CannotOverWriteExistingCassetteException`. This is because the test makes a new HTTPS request that's not recorded in the corresponding cassette file. The cassette file thus needs to be updated.

Before doing so, you'll want to test using live connection to confirm that the test actually pass and the failure is caused solely by an outdated cassette:

```sh
pytest --disable-recording
```

If your tests pass when using live connection, it means the cassettes indeed need update. Simply run one of these:

```sh
# Rewrite existing cassettes but disallow creating new cassette files
# For modifying existing tests
pytest --record-mode=rewrite

# Create new cassette files but disallow modifying existing cassettes
# For adding new tests
pytest --record-mode=once
```

Alternatively, you can remove the `tests/cassettes` folder entirely and record from scratch:

```sh
# NOT RECOMMENDED, this is a nuclear option. For "if-all-else-fails"-type situation,
# or when there's very significant change to the test suite file structures.
rm -r tests/cassettes
pytest --record-mode=once
```

After making changes to the cassettes, don't forget to save the cassettes into version control, for example by doing:

```sh
git commit tests/cassettes -m "test: Re-record cassettes for passing test XXX XXX XXX"
```

Note that doing a live request to WAQI requires a token to be supplied. The test suite loads the token from an environment variable. To set this environment variable, you can make a file named `.env` in Ozon3 root directory with the following content:

```
WAQI_TOKEN=insert_your_token_here
```

Or you can pass the environment variable to the shell environment. For example, in Git Bash you can do this when invoking pytest:

```sh
WAQI_TOKEN=insert_your_token_here pytest --disable-recording
```

Finally, after updating the cassettes, perform the test one more time to confirm that the cassettes don't cause problems:

```sh
# equivalent to just invoking "pytest"
pytest --record-mode=none
```

> To have more confidence that the tests will not go over the wire, the `--block-network` flag can also be passed to block all network access.

## World Air Quality Index's API

Ozon3 uses the World Air Quality Index's API under the hood to fetch its data. We have included some links to information about the API to help during contribution.

* Find information on the World Air Quality Index website [here](https://waqi.info/)
* Find information on different APIs used by Air Quality Programs [here](https://aqicn.org/api/)

## Style Guides

### Git commit messages

Commmits should be made in this format:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

<optional detailed description>
```

* `fix`: To show that a bug fix or patch has been made.
* `feat`: To show that a new feature/enhancement has been added.
* `BREAKING CHANGE`: For changes that introduce backward-incompatible updates. Backward-incompatibility happens when code that uses Ozon3's **public** API needs to be modified to account for an update. (As opposed to code using Ozon3's **private** or **internal-usage** API, which is not meant for public use)
* `refactor`: If you've rearranged/refactored existing code by splitting it into separate files/methods/functions/classes, or by using a slightly different implementation detail, reasonably without changing functionality.
* `test`: Any modification of tests.
* `ci/cd`: Any changes related to continuous integration/deployment tasks, such as GitHub actions.
* `chore`: For behind the scenes stuff that doesn't affect the Ozon3's API. This could include things like version bumps, change in dependencies, etc.
* `docs`: For entirely documentation related changes. README, CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, and even docstrings in methods, all come under this.
* `style`: For a commit that solely has to do with things like spaces instead of tabs, or " instead of ', etc. This can be used if you've formatted code with black/flake8 and wish to make a commit.

> **Note:** The above guidelines were added on 8th Mar, 2022. All commits before this time do not have these prefixes.

Here are a few other tips:

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
* Add descriptions where needed, to explain your commit in more detail.

### Python style guide

* Follow the [pep8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) styleguide.
* Format with flake8 and black.
* Add docstrings with formats as shown in existing code.



## Github Branching Model

Ozon3 branches are created using a Github branching model. In this branching model, each branch serves a purpose and offers team members a shared undestanding  of the branching system.

See more information on this branching model [here](https://github.com/Ozon3Org/Ozon3/discussions/24).
